# ecosystem-simulation

A python program that simulates the evolution of a simple ecosystem with zebras and lions

Ecosystem consists of animal living on grid where each square in the grid is of size 1km by 1km

one square is occupied by one animal only or is empty

The duration for the simulation is 20 months.

Animals in the ecosystem will reproduce, move and hunt for food, and finally die (either of old age or starvation)

Below are the outlying conditions for the behaviour of the animal within the ecosystem:

max. age of lion is 18 months and max. age of zebra is 7 months

If a lion hasn't eaten for 6 months, it'll die of starvation. It is assumed there is always grass for zebras to eat so it never dies of starvation.

Lions reproduce at age 7 months and 14 months. Zebras reproduce at age 3 months and 6 months.
